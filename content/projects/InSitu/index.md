Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures.

<!--more-->
- Designed an In Situ Flight Data Analysis (iFDA) toolbox for turboprop aircraft, offering real-time performance calculations and decision-making aids, validated within 3% accuracy against flight manuals and simulations.
- Integrated terrain proximity analysis and dynamic decision support to improve operational safety in complex, geographically constrained short takeoff and landing (STOL) environments.
- Demonstrated the toolbox’s capability in real-time path planning and Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) avoidance for challenging terrains, such as Nepal’s Annapurna region.
